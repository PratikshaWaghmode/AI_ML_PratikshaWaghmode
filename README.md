📚 AI-Powered Knowledge Graph to Manim Animation Automation
🌟 Overview

This project automates the creation of educational videos using AI + Knowledge Graphs + Manim.
Instead of only returning text explanations, the system generates slides, a teaching script, and an animated video that visually explains the concept.

The idea is to make learning more interactive, automated, and scalable by combining:

📖 Knowledge Graphs → storing and connecting concepts

🤖 AI Models → generating scripts & explanations

🎬 Manim → transforming ideas into animated videos

🔑 How It Works

User Query → Student enters a topic (e.g., Binary Trees or Photosynthesis).

Knowledge Graph Retrieval → Fetches related concepts & subtopics.

AI Content Generation → Produces structured slides + narration script.

Formatting Layer → Converts content into a clean storyboard.

Manim Automation → Generates animations, adds narration & captions.

Final Output → A complete MP4 educational video.

⚙️ Technical Workflow

Backend → Python (Flask/FastAPI) orchestrating modules

AI Layer → NLP for summarization & script generation

Knowledge Graph → Neo4j / NetworkX for concept storage

Slide & Script Generator → Python-based formatter

Animation Engine → Manim (auto-rendered)

Storage → Local/Cloud for generated outputs

📑 Pseudo-Code (General Flow)
START
INPUT: user_query

concept_data = retrieve_concept_from_KG(user_query)
slides, script = generate_slides_and_script(concept_data)
storyboard = format_content(slides, script)
manim_code = generate_manim_code(storyboard)
video_output = render_video_with_manim(manim_code)
final_video = add_audio_and_captions(video_output, script)

OUTPUT: final_video (MP4)
END

🎯 Why This Matters

Saves time for teachers by automating video creation.

Helps students learn faster through interactive visuals.

Scales easily to multiple domains → Algorithms, Space Tech, GIS, Physics, etc.

🚀 Future Scope

Integration of advanced Knowledge Graphs for concept linking.

Adding Text-to-Speech (TTS) for natural narration.

Benchmarking LLMs for spatial reasoning in animations.
